Finally, it puts the pop artists' dictionaries in the pop dictionary, and the hyperpop artists' dictionaries in the hyperpop dictionary. I kept stopwords in the KWIC analysis to make it easier to understand context."

    "The difference between utilizing \"girl\" is even more stark than using \"boy\". In hyperpop, there are virtually no objects of affection addressed towards a girl. In hyperpop, the lyrics here are all either accosting another woman (\"your man came up to me, girl, believe what you believe\") or self-referential (\"in the city I'm just another girl in a sweater\"). In pop, the word girl is used as the object of affection (\"nobody's gonna love you like me, girl\"), or self-referentially as well (\"I stare at the girl in the mirror\"). I'm also noticing that a lot of the keywords in the past two analyses have come from repetition in the same songs. For example, Dorian Electra's \"Career Boy\" appeared 4 times in the \"boy\" KWIC analysis, which is 1/5 of the whole sample."

For example, the most intense lyrics in the hyperpop example is \"i want you to get freaky\" and \"I want rock & rollers, I want rolling stoners\". There aren't any comparable lyrics in the pop KWIC analysis."
