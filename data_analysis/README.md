## Data analysis notebooks for COMM313 Final Project

This folder contains 3 notebooks: functions, Data Descriptives and Keyness analysis, and KWIC analysis

The functions notebook contains functions utilized in the other two notebooks.

The data descriptives and keyness analysis notebook creates dictionaries and counters to make the corpus easier to work with, and then describes features of the data such as the length, and then provides a keyness analysis.

The KWIC notebook uses important keywords found in the keyness analysis to complete a KWIC analysis.
