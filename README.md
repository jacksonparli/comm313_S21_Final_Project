## Hyperpop Vs. Pop Lyricism


Hyperpop is a genre invented in 2014 with the founding of the English music label PC Music. The genre is an exaggerated form of pop, characterized by extremely autotuned vocals, heavy production, and emphasis on synths. Many of these artists collaborate with eachother and AG, and often tend to emphasize queer values and party subculture. While the production of the music itself is more electronic and exaggerated than typical pop, I wnated to examine if the lyrics were different in any substantial way. My research question is "does hyperpop lyricism emphasize party culture more than pop music?" I have four subfolders for this project including:

* The data subfolder: contains the corpus for this project, gathered by utilizing the genius API in a jupyter notebook called data gathering. The data is broken up into three folders, json files (contains json files with data about the albums I will be analyzing), pop (contains text files with the lyrics to the pop albums I will be analyzing), and hyperpop (contains text files with the lyrics to the pop albums I will be analyzing)

* The data analysis subfolder: contains the data analysis I did using this corpus. It contains one notebook for basic analysis (corpus length, most common words, etc.) and a keyness analysis, and another notebook for KWIC analysis.

* The presentation folder: a PDF of a slideshow I gave in class, detailing my steps in the project at that point and what my plans were for next steps

* The final data story subfolder: Contains my final blog post about my analysis on pop versus hyperpop lyricism
