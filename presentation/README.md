## Progress presentation for COMM313 Final Project

This presentation gave an update at where I am in completing this data analysis project.
It gives a quick history of hyperpop, and details my research question and hypothesis. It then goes on to detail how the data was collected (Genius API) and a description of the data.

After describing the data, it discusses my preliminary keyness analysis of the data, and details my plans for the rest of the project.
