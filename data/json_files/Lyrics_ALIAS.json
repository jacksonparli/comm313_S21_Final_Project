Get in my head?\"\nThat's what they'll say\nWhen they find out\nAre my secrets safe with you?\nWhat's too good, too easy, too sweet?\nCome find me\nI'm free, at 3\n\n[Verse 3]\nI see you creep, I can creep too\nI do every time\nYou're too busy on the low, you don't see that I get mine\nCome and get it too\nIf you want it, you can have it more\nTryna get got, but you man never fail to fall\nAnd you're trying to teach tricks\nBut I guess I'm really too young\nCan't get a grip\nWhen you see me, you just play dumb\n(I'm an enemy)\nIf I was you, if you was me\nWould you run or would you flee?\nTen toes to your hoes, who wait up when I'm asleep\n(Bad, naughty\nLike what you see?)\n\n[Outro]\nI don't know better, I can't really tell\nWhy ride with the devil when I can give you hell?"
