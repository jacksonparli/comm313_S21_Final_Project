Is it so complicated?\nYou know the shapes my body makes\nUnder the sheets at 4 AM with you\nThe things that we break when we\u2019re switchin' positions\nYou know the words to my mistakes\nYou understand because you made 'em too\n\n[Chorus]\nThe things that I say when you don't wanna listen\nThings that you say when I make bad decisions\nThings that we do by the sink in my kitchen\nI remember our first date\nNo chocolate and no bouquet\nBut the way that you kissed me\nThese are the things that could make us official\n\n[Bridge]\nAll of the things that we sometimes forget\nAll of the dreams that you put in my head\nI'm still asleep, but there's breakfast in bed\nThese are the things that could make us official\nMaybe the sky might not always be blue\nAll of my wishes will never come true\nIt doesn't matter 'cause I\u2019m here with you\nThis stuff could make us official\nSo tell all your friends \u2019cause we're goin\u2019 official\n\n[Chorus]\nThings that you say when I make bad decisions\nThings that we do by the sink in my kitchen\nI remember our first date\nNo chocolate and no bouquet\nBut the way that you kissed me\nThese are the things that could make us official\nThese are the things that could make us official\nThese are the things that could make us official\nI remember our first date\nNo chocolate and no bouquet\nBut the way that you kissed me\nThese are the things that could make us official"

pussy palace\nAnd shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale\nMy pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail\nMy pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup\nI'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club\nHey, my ass is Magic City\nDouble Ds, all-natural big titties\nShake it like a box-fresh vibrator\nAss first-class, fast like Concorde\nDamn, my ass so insane\nPut me in a straightjacket, still you ain't safe\nYou can't handle all the jelly, put it on a plate\nI'm 'bout to shake and leave you shook, like Beyonc\u00e9\n\n[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]\n(Shake it, I shake it, I sh- I shake it)\n(I shake it, I sha- I shake it)\nOh darling, you say you don't know me?\n(I sh- I shake it- I shake it)\nPlease, haha\n(I sh- I shake it)\n(Pabllo Vittar)\n\n[Verse 4: Pabllo Vittar]\nPra come\u00e7ar direito eu soletro pra voc\u00ea\nRainha se escreve com dois L e dois T\nComo estagi\u00e1rio no trabalho, eu t\u00f4 sem tempo\nSe tenho um problema eu resolvo com talento\nDedinho na boca, sou uma tenta\u00e7\u00e3o\nA pista pega fogo derretendo o pared\u00e3o\nJ\u00e1 mostrei que eu sou queen, falo s\u00e9rio pra voc\u00eas\nA coroa \u00e9 pesada, mas eu me acostumei\nI shake it, I shake it, o meu popoz\u00e3o\nI shake it, I shake it, aguentar essa press\u00e3o\nDo MA, cheguei em LA\n\u00c9 a Pabllo e a Charli mais uma vez\n\n[Chorus: Charli XCX & Pabllo Vittar]\nI shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh\nI shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh\nI shake it, I shake it all on you (XCX)\nI shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh (Mais uma vez, haha)\nI shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh\nI shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh (I love you, Charli, baby)\nI shake it, I shake it all on you\nI shake it, I shake"
