Can\u2019t you tell I'm wired?\nTell me nothing lasts, like I don't know\nYou could kiss my\u2014 asking about my motto\n\n[Interlude]\nYou should enter it in festivals or carnivals\nThoughts? Pretty good reaction\nPretty cool... right?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou are my strange addiction\nYou are my strange addiction\nMy doctors can't explain\nMy symptoms or my pain\nBut you are my strange addiction\n\n[Outro]\nDid you like it?

Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?\nToday, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly\nThe way I'm drinkin' you down\nLike I wanna drown, like I wanna end me\n\n[Refrain: Billie Eilish]\nStep on the glass, staple your tongue (Ahh)\nBury a friend, try to wake up (Ah-ahh)\nCannibal class, killing the son (Ahh)\nBury a friend, I wanna end me\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Billie Eilish]\nI wanna end me\nI wanna, I wanna, I wanna\u2026 end me\nI wanna, I wanna, I wanna\u2026\n\n[Chorus: Billie Eilish]\nWhat do you want from me?
