Nothing new, ooh\nBaby, I could never be replaced\nBut your new girl is cute though\nYou should know to never play with fire\n'Cause I'm always ready to attack\nYeah, I heard that you been talking trash\nI ain't having none of that\n\n[Chorus]\nYou bad mouth every friend that you have\nAnd I know it for a fact 'cause they call you out by name\nFucked up every dream that you had\nWith the scenes and the fads\nBaby, you just look so lame\nYou try to repair what you broke\nBut you slipped up again and you ran away back home\nNow you have nobody to turn to\nI think that you belong alone\n\n[Break]\nThat you belong alone\nThat you belong alone, babe\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nBaby, please\nYou lost your mind if you think that you could hurt me\nI'm at ease, yeah, I'm on top of the world\nIt's clear that you do not deserve me\nI hope your girlfriend sees all the messages\nThat you been sending my way\nAnd that you end up alone\nHey, hey, hey\n\n[Chorus]\nYou bad mouth every friend that you have\nAnd I know it for a fact 'cause they call you out by name\nFucked up every dream that you had\nWith the scenes and the fads\nBaby, you just look so lame\nYou try to repair what you broke\nBut you slipped up again and you ran away back home\nNow you have nobody to turn to\nI think that you belong alone"
