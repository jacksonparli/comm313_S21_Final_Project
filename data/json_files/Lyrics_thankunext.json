Gee, thanks, just bought it\nI see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)\n\n[Chorus]\nI want it, I got it, I want it, I got it\nI want it, I got it, I want it, I got it\nYou like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it\nI see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)\n\n[Verse 2]\nWearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no \"Mrs.\"\nBought matching diamonds for six of my bitches\nI'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches\nThink retail therapy my new addiction\nWhoever said money can't solve your problems\nMust not have had enough money to solve 'em\nThey say, \"Which one?\" I say, \"Nah, I want all of 'em\"\nHappiness is the same price as red-bottoms\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nMy smile is beamin' (Yeah), my skin is gleamin' (Is gleamin')\nThe way it shine, I know you've seen it (You've seen it)\nI bought a crib just for (Just for) the closet (Closet)\nBoth his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI want it, I got it, I want it, I got it\nI want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Baby)\nYou like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it (Oh yeah)\nI see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers\nIf it ain't money, then wrong number\nBlack card is my business card\nThe way it be settin' the tone for me\nI don't mean to brag, but I be like, \"Put it in the bag,\" yeah\nWhen you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah\nShoot, go from the store to the booth\nMake it all back in one loop, gimme the loot\nNever mind, I got the juice\nNothing but net when we shoot\nLook at my neck, look at my jet\nAin't got enough money to pay me respect\nAin't no budget when I'm on the set\nIf I like it, then that's what I get, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nI want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah)\nI want it, I got it, I want it, I got it (Oh yeah, yeah)\nYou like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it\nI see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (I see, yep)"
