## Data files for COMM313 Final Project

This folder has five items in it:
    the json_files folder
    the pop folder
    the hyperpop folder
    the data gathering notebook
    and the functions notebook
    
The data gathering notebook is the notebook used to build the corpus. It created the files in both the json_files folder as well as the files in the pop and hyperpop folders. The functions notebook supports the data gathering notebook by providing any additional functions utilized to gather the corpus. The json_files folder contains json files for the 20 albums being analyzed in the project. The pop folder contains 10 text files with strings from each of the 10 pop albums, named after each album. The hyperpop folder contains the same, but with hyperpop albums instead.
