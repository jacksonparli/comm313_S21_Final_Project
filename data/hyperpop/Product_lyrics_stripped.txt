JUMP!We were young and outta control
I haven't seen you since I was about, mm, sixteen years old
But then you called me up the other day
I was shocked, but what could I say?
And your voice exactly the same
And it makes me feel, makes me feel

Oh, just like we never said goodbye
When you spoke to me in that way
Oh, just like we never said goodbye
And it makes me feel, makes me feel

We went out the very next day
You still remember my favorite place
And we laughed, just like we used to
And did everything we like to do
And now we’re holding hands and running
And it makes me feel, makes me feel

Oh, just like we never said goodbye
When you looked at me that way
Oh, just like we never said goodbye
And it makes me feel, makes me feel
Oh, just like we never said goodbye
When you held my hand that way
Oh, just like we never said goodbye
And it makes me feel, makes me feel

We were young
We had everything we wanted
Running wild through the night
We were young
We had everything we needed
And I see that now that you’re here with me
I’ve got everything that I could ever need
And it makes me feel, and it makes me feel
And it makes me feel, makes me feel

Oh, just like we never said goodbye
When you held my hand in that way
Oh, just like we never said goodbye
And it makes me feel, makes me feel

Still got that glint in your eye
Like you did the very first time
Oh, it's like we never said goodbye
And it makes me feel, makes me feel, like everything that I could ever need
And it makes me feel, and it makes me feel, like I don't ever wanna say goodbyeLet your body get higher
