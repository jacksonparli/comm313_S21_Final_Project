I guess, I mean, I know
It's kind of bad
Naughty, for you
Waiting, watching, fantasizing
So you like what you see?

Could say I didn't like it but I did
Guess I wasn't raised right
Mumsy made a naughty kid
Daddy raised a wild one
Daddy raised a fiend
Pulling up on bitches every chance I get
Villain of the scene
I don't need a crew, I don't need a team (Warming up)
Giving energy, hotter than a flicky to your neck
I'm an enemy
(I'm an enemy)

Only got a bad side
Get to know that side of me
We can mash work if you're feeling mean
Coming like a thug from the bed to the street
Keep it certy 24/7 days of the week
I don't know bеtter, I can't really tell
Why ridе with the devil when I could give you hell?

"Did you use me? Get in my head?"
That's what they'll say
When they find out
Are my secrets safe with you?
What's too good, too easy, too sweet?
Come find me
I'm free, at 3

I see you creep, I can creep too
I do every time
You're too busy on the low, you don't see that I get mine
Come and get it too
If you want it, you can have it more
Tryna get got, but you man never fail to fall
And you're trying to teach tricks
But I guess I'm really too young
Can't get a grip
When you see me, you just play dumb
(I'm an enemy)
If I was you, if you was me
Would you run or would you flee?
Ten toes to your hoes, who wait up when I'm asleep
(Bad, naughty
Like what you see?)

I don't know better, I can't really tell
Why ride with the devil when I can give you hell?The way I got you on the run
I hear you say “let’s fuck all night”
Feeling something better
I might fuck her if I’m feeling tight
Right, umm got me feeling something that I need to get that itch scratched
Turn around and give to papi, yeah I wanna
Bad bitches always have to keep their hands wet
We're too slick
I like to glide, figure skate on a bitch
Turn her out, she likes a ride
Is she cute?
Yeah, she might
She a baddie for the season or a baddie for the night

She tore it, look at that slime
That silk smooth dutty wine
Every inch she moves what's mine
Yup, yup
She’s for the streets, bitch (And that’s fine)
She’s for the streets, bitch (Mm)

Tell me now, if you’re looking to get down
In the back, in the front
On the highway in your truck
I don’t give a fuck, turn me up
Let me hear it louder
I can never get enough
Is it rough?
When you see me in the club
With the bottles turning up
I got pretty mean bitches
If you want it, try your luck
Only stunting with the A team
Know you wanna touch
Bite it off
Real Rottweiler bitch
In the streets when I want

Yeah, you can holla me
Back of the club with the Hennessy
Two shots and I'm running lean
Come pour me up [x2]
