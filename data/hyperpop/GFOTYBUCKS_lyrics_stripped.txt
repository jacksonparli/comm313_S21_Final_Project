Fake tan, don't need it
Pink, don't feel it
Got hair, don't want it
Bus fare, he's got it (Hey)
My song, I'm on it
My song, I'm on it
My song, get off it
My song, I'm on it
(Late night, but I've got to go)
My song, get off it
My song, I'm on it

Get me on my own and see
I'm the only girl for me
A thousand ways to hurt you
(Without my friends I'm better)
Get me on my own and see

Don't talk to me about VIP
Cause you know I've got the key
Invited to Mahiki on Dover Street
Where the drinks are cheap
(Without my friends I'm better)
Walking down the street in my brand new car
X5, blacked out Range Rover

Bad things happen, not to me though
I'm quite sorry that we've crossed roads
I know it's hard, keep on walking
Stop the thinking, no one's talking

Calm down for a minute, I've got the answer!
Sit down, it's cool, I figured it out

He told me he loved me and I was the one
This is fun, now you're done, 'cause I believe

The length of straws
Is this your number?
The liquid floors
I found a number
Hold on baby, I found a plan
There's a queue on arrival, an elaborate man
Slowly hungry (9)
I found a sandwich
I'll eat it quickly (2)
If you eat my sandwich (1)
The space between us (20, 60)
He's a winner (25)
My drink's a Pepsi (88)
But I'm getting thinner (7)

I don't want to haunt you, you
I swear you shrink each time I'm near

I tried to concentrate, my mind wants to explore (doves)
The tropical scent of you takes me up above
And boy when I look at you, oh I fall in love (cold showers)
No doubt you look so fine (umbrellas)
Boy I want to make you mine (Pina Colada)
I want to be with a cool guy just like you (luscious, sweet)
No doubt I'm the only girl, who can love you like I can (ocean, submarine)
So just let me be with, the cool man that I love

Angel, Mistletoe, Christmas Day
Let me ride your Christmas sleigh
Angel, Mistletoe, Christmas Day
Let me ride your Christmas sleigh

Found the cheer
But a lot today
It's not about the money, it's the gifts today
The gift of food and brand new games
And wearing a hat that says Christmas Day

Angel, Mistletoe, Christmas Day
Let me ride your Christmas sleigh
Angel, Mistletoe, Christmas Day
Let me ride your Christmas sleigh
Angel, Mistletoe, Christmas Day
Let me ride your Christmas sleigh

Fell in love with a tiny elf
In the shape of a snowflake on Christmas Day
Snowman B-F-O-T-Y has melted away
It's sad, it's Christmas day

Christmas hat, yuletide, my jingle brew
Present, egg nog, Santa
Paws, reindeer, tree
Elves, gifts, mistletoe
Noel, cheer at Christmas time
Father Christmas
Elf

I'm here to tell you a story
The story of how we got here
And why, you are my final sin

Medicine is not a fuel
It's your potion Dr. Cool
Medicine is not a fuel
You're the paint and I'm the wall

Sugar coated remedy
You're the something that I need
You make me beg, you make me plead
Another dose of liquid please!

Why didn't you reply?

(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)

Medicine is not a fuel
It's your potion Dr. CoolAll the, small things
True care, truth brings
I'll take, one lift
Your ride, best trip
Always, I know
You'll be, at my show
Watching, waiting
Commiserating

I will not go
Turn the lights off
Carry me home

I will not go
Turn the lights off
