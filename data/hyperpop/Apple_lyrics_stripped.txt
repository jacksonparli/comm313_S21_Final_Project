You're beautiful, you superstarWe sit by the side
And observe all the animals
I try not to laugh
'Cause I know it's the end of us
I fry from the heat
But the sun isn't killing me
We run from our death
When we cum are we really free? (Ahh-ahh-ahh)

Primal rage
Life is a cage
It's nothing
I can live (Ahh-ahh-ahh)

You sit in your throne
You decide, "Off with his head"
She kneels at your feet
She feels cold, "Something more to eat?"
Queen dies in her sleep
There's no time, king must not weep
We look at our phone
Every morning, battery is dead
Battery is dead
Battery is dead

Kiss the sky
Tear in your eye
It's nothing
That I can live without

Live withoutLetting go
Watching the days get brighter
No more holding on
Holding on

Letting go
Watching you start a fire
No more holding on
Holding on

Letting go
Watching the days get brighter
No more holding on
Holding on

Letting go
Watching you start a fire
No more holding on
Holding on

Letting go
Watching the days get brighter
No more holding on
Holding on
Letting go
Watching you start a fire
No more holding on
Holding on'Cause baby I know that you love life, hey

My reflectionCan't turn around
So I'm not looking down
Don't have a sound
It's a collaboration
I'm falling down
Just to feel the ground
My phone stopped ringing

Cos every time I shake my head
You know I really mean yeah yeah yeah
And every time I go to bed
I dream of reaching out
But I'm awake at 5AM
And it's too early yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can't believe we only met
Through non-existent friends

Live your life before it's over
Live your second life before your first one's over
If I had to choose a better way
For you to see me
Every day I make my world a little clearer

I feel the rain but I see no clouds
I look around

Cos every time I shake my head
You know I really mean yeah yeah yeah
And every time I go to bed
I dream of reaching out
But I'm awake at 5AM
And it's too early yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can't believe we only met
Through non-existent friends

Live your life before it's over
Live your second life before your first one's over
If I had to choose a better way
For you to see me
Every day I see the world a little clearer

I heard you falling
I heard you falling
I heard you fallingYou-ou are my lifeline
You, you are my lifeline

Take a look at my soul
Try to dip it in gold
So they tell us lay low
Turn the key and let's go

And I don't know what I'm thinking
But I believe there's a reason
If every door is left open
Would you show me the way?
(Oh, yeah)

You-ou are my lifeline
You, you are my lifeline

You-ou are my lifeline
You, you are my lifeline

Melody with no notes
Memories with no home
DNA with no bones
Artificially grown

And I don't know what they're thinking
But I believe there's a reason
If every door is left open
Would you show me the way?

You-ou are my lifeline
You, you are my lifeline

You-ou are my lifeline
You, you are my lifeline

You're my lifeline
You are
You are my

You-ou are my lifeline
You, you are my lifeline (Would you show me the way?)
You-ou are my lifeline
You, you are my lifeline (Would you show me the way?)

You-ou are my lifeline
You, you are my lifeline
