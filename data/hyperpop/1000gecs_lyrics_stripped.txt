You circled me inside my room, I couldn't go another day
This feeling's going to my head, I'm thinking things I shouldn't say

Spill the blood on the floor, I ain't scared, think there's more
What the fuck? Make it stop, took too long, here right now
On the floor, in the car, smoking cigs in the bar
I don't want you to think I got bad intentions
Never wanted you inside, you made it your mission, yeah
Didn't wanna hurt no one but you just went and made it fun, fun, fun, fun

I hear you're lookin' for a way to fight the Corpus bride
She's workin' in my mind
And you're lookin' for a way to crush, it's not enough
You fucked up your last try (last try)
We were in the studio, I was just playin'
You were all work and I was all play and
You were talkin' business, aiming with your weapon
I was on your hit list, I felt the compression

I'll never go, I'll haunt your studio
You won't think of words when you write it up
You'll just hear me singing this song
You'll think that's okay, you'll just sing along
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me too
You just copy everything we do
If I wasn't me, I'd copy me tooI look outside and see your bright eyes
I don't know if I can get to you
Don't know if I'll be back (If I'll be back)
I don't know how to be alone
I'm always looking at the phone
