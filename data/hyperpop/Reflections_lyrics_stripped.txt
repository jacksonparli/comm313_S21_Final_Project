Reflection

So far from perfection
Wish that I could transform my reflection (Reflection)
See through imperfections
All in my mind, so hard to hide (To hide, to hide, to hide)

Two of me
I see things that you can't see
Replace and delete
Makeover my reality
Erase you from me
'Cause you're in perfect symmetry
You are not like me
You're not who I want to be

It's all a deception
You don't know who you are, it's a question (A question)
But you are perfection
Hard to believe, but you will see (Will see, will see, will see)

Two of you
You see things you don't want to
Rewind and undo
This feels like it's déjà vu
You'll be shining through
Wiping off the residue
A clearer view
Of you for youWhen I saw you with her
When I saw you kissing her
I can't get that picture out of my mind
When I am around you
I could be invisible
Do you wish I wasn't even there, sometimes?

See right through, what you do
Deep down, I know she's with you and so

I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, and so
I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own

So invisible
Am I invisible?
Am I invisible?
Am I invisible?

I'd go out and party
But I'm scared of what I'll see
So I'll stay home tonight
And every night
I wanted to tell you
But I couldn't make a sound
Maybe if you heard me
You'd see me now

See right through, what you do
Deep down I know she's with you and so

I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, and so
I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own

So invisible
Am I invisible?

You don't know that I'm here
On my own
I was born on my own
And I'll dance on my own
No, no, no
You don't know that I'm here
On my own
I was born on my own
And I'll dance on my own
No, no, no

I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, and so
I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, on my own
Tonight, and so
I'll just be on my own
Tonight, on my own

So invisible
Am I invisible?
Am I invisible?Maybe I'm good on my own
Could it be time to let go?
Sometimes I wanna believe in you
Then I remember it's you (Oh-oh)

How did it end up like this? (Oh-oh)
Gone with the wind like a kiss (Oh-oh)
Breaking my heart just to try (Oh-oh)
Staying alive 'til I die

And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on

And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on

Sometimes it's hard on my own
Falling asleep by the phone
Sometimes it feels like I'm missing you
Then I remember it's you (Oh-oh)

What if we just hadn't met? (Oh-oh)
Is it so hard to forget? (Oh-oh)
Breaking my heart just to try (Oh-oh)
Staying alive 'til I die

And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my heart goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on

And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes on


I went out tonight
I cried once or twice
I met someone new
But he's not like you
And I kissed his face
In a different place
And he's not the one
But my love goes on
I went out tonight
I cried once or twice
I met someone new
But he's not like you
And I kissed his face
In a different place
And he's not the one
But my love goes on

And my love goes on
And my love goes on
And my love goes onYou were the end, the beginning
The one I found myself wishing wouldn't fade away
You were the light in the darkness
You made me laugh and cry harder than I can explain

Was I just there when you were lonely?
I felt how you thought it should feel to hold me
How could you give me something that wasn't there?
Wasn't there
Why don't you care?

Never wanna hear you a- (a-)
Apologize again
(Apologize again)
Never wanna see that look (look)
That look in your eyes again
Said you were sorry
You weren't though
Said you had told me
But still you
Lied every time that I listened
Out of the rain
Never again

I let you into my life, never really opened my eyes
So you'd look up at me
You said the words, I believed you
But now you're leaving me thinking they don't mean a thing

Was I just there when you were lonely?
I felt how you thought it should feel to hold me
How could you give me something that wasn't there?

Why don't you care?

Never wanna hear you a- (a-)

Never wanna see that look (look)

Out of the rain
Never again

Over and over again

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-a-a-a-a, la-laThe risks you took
So when I looked
I wouldn't see for a while
I saw the signs
Bright flashing lights
I closed my eyes for a while

Didn’t see you at my show
Never told me yes or no

I look in your eyes, I see right through
I know that you've found someone new
Why would you lie? What should I do?
Now I know it's not true

Like a diamond being crushed, you’ve turned my heart to dust
You say the words but your face doesn't match up

I checked in, you're checking out
Holding up lies so we can make out

I look in your eyes, I see right through
I know that you've found someone new
Why would you lie? What should I do?
Now I know it's not true
Now that I know it's not true
Now that you've found someone new
Now that I know what to do

I don't need you (Don’t need you)
No, I don’t (No, I don't)
Now I know it’s not true
No epiphanies
No "believe in me"'s
No more chances wasted on nobodies
Every time you lie, you become that guy
There's no point, there's no time
Maybe you’ll treat her right

No, it's not true
I always knew (Always knew)
But now I know it's not true
Not trueLet me breathe you in, and breathe the words in your mouth
Inside you're shivering, the silence shouts so loud
I just want to, I just want to stay around
And while my heart beats, I promise I won't let you down

If I'm somewhere else, it doesn't mean that I don't see
That you don't trust yourself, that's why you don't trust me
It makes me crazy, when you're crazy
You don't speak, you think you know me
But what you know is just skin deep

If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are
Soon there'll be nothing at all, 'til the concrete angel falls

And he was lying around me
And I had this incredible sense of peace
Just came over me and I knew
I knew, I knew that I was in presence of angel

If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are
Soon there'll be nothing at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are
Soon there'll be nothing at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are
Soon there'll be nothing at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
I knew who you were from the start
But now I don't know who you are
Soon there'll be nothing at all, 'til the concrete angel falls
If you keep building these walls, brick by brick, towers so tall
Soon I won't see you at all, 'til the concrete angel
'Til the concrete angel falls

Concrete angel, concrete angel, concrete angel fallsBoy, stop pretending
This can't be the ending
You know that I like you
Much more than a friends thing
You said that you've been thinking
Things need time to sink in
But when I'm without you
I can't stop my heart sinking

Going or gone
You're going or going or gone
You're going or going or gone
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone
Going or gone, gone, gone
You're going or going or gone
You're going or going or gone
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone

Can't sleep, (can't sleep)
Where are you?
Can't stop thinking about (What we've been through)
Every night I close my eyes but I'm awake
('Cause all the dreams we had, you took away)
Got your text, you say we're done
But I know what you're like
It's not over yet

Boy, stop pretending
This can't be the ending
You know that I like you
Much more than a friends thing
You said that you've been thinking
Things need time to sink in
But when I'm without you
I can't stop my heart sinking

Going or gone
You're going or going or gone
You're going or going or gone
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone
Going or gone, gone, gone
You're going or going or gone
You're going or going or gone
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone

Made your choice (Your choice)
Can't hear my voice (Goodbye)
You'll miss me when you're gone
(Now you're gone)
You made me feel loved
(Like how it feels in a movie
Now it's a film I don't wanna see)
First it's off and then it's on
Don't know if I'm coming or going
Or coming or going or going or gone

Boy, stop pretending
This can't be the ending
You know that I like you
Much more than a friends thing
You said that you've been thinking
Things need time to sink in
But when I'm without you
I can't stop my heart sinking

Stop my heart sinking (stop my heart sinking)
Stop my heart sinking (stop my heart sinking)
Stop my heart sinking
Stop my heart sinking
Stop my heart sinking

I said: "Nothing"
Nothing's really
Sometimes, something

Took my time to figure out what's truly real
Told myself it's wrong to fake the way I feel

But I'm still shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy

You said: "Let's kiss"
I said nothing
Maybe, I should have
Said something

Took my time to figure out what's truly real
Told myself it's wrong to fake the way I feel

But I'm still shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy

Things that I did
Faded away
Just cause I didn't
Know when to say
"I like you"

Took my time to figure out what's truly real
Told myself it's wrong to fake the way I feel

But I'm still shy
I-I-I'm so-so
Shy
I-I-I'm so-so
ShyMaybe you've given up
Maybe it's just  my luck
Wish we could talk things through
Wish I could click undo

Don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone, and then you'll see
If it's me you like
Or the way I make you feel
Alive
But so dead inside
Are we just a memory?
Already fading...

Already fading...

Day after day
You fa-a-a-ade awa-a-a-ay
From me
Baby, please
Just sta-a-a-ay, don't fa-a-a-ade away...

I always thought I'd be
The picture saved on your screen
Now it's of something else
What does that even mean?

Don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone and then you'll see
If it's me you like
Or the way I make you feel
Alive
But so dead inside
Are we just a memory?
Already fading...

(Oh-oh)
I got your face in a book, baby
(Oh-oh)
It's like you're with me inside my head
Whenever I miss you I see you there
I want to take you along with me
Don't go now

Do you look at me?
I look at you
You say the words
I want to hear
You hold my hand
I shed a tear
I close my eyes
Thinkin' of you
You make it real
And I believe
'Cause when you speak
Visions appear
You look at me
I look at you
You say the words
I love you

(Ooh-ooh)
I make believe with you
I make believe
I make believe with you, with you
(Ooh-ooh)
I make believe with you

I could get so lost with you, baby
(Oh-oh)
I've got a daydream for two, baby
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You could be with me all of the time
We'll never be lonely inside my mind
I want to take you along with me
Don't go now

Do you look at me?
I look at you
You say the words
I want to hear
You hold my hand
I shed a tear
I close my eyes
Thinkin' of you
You make it real
