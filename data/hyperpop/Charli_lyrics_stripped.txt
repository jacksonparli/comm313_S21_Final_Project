I go hard, I go fast
And I never look back
I go speedin' on the highway
Burn rubber, no crash
Turn the volume up in the party
Put your hands up and dance
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Bounce, never sleep
Push it all on repeat
I go speedin' on the highway
Flame burning, tire screech
Turn the volume up in your bedroom
Put your hands up and scream
Bump, bump, lights go out
Go forever and ever and

Drop, body high
Blue and pink like the sky
I go speedin' on the highway
Vroom vroomin', might die
Turn the volume up in your Prius
Windows down and just vibe
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Roll wit' your friends, out till 7 AM
Come on, meet me on the highway
Smoke blowing, let's race
Turn the volume up on the speakers
Got that look on your face
Bump, bump, in the rave
Go forever and ever and

Why do we love?

I would lay down (Lay down)
But they staring, their eyes like two shining stones
I see myself (Myself), and I look scared and confused
Wait, did they just talk? Why is it too loud? (Is it loud?)
Do they wish to run through me? (Me)
Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? And who decides? (Oh)

I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people

So many problems (Ah-ah), I try to drown 'em out
1000 bottles (Ah-ah), collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the only good inside of me is you

I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

You're so forgiving (Ah-ah), my friends think you're the best
From the beginning (Ah-ah), your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection (Ah-ah), it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the best damn part of me was always you

Kisses fall on her lips
Kisses that should've been mine, yeah

What you've done, what you've done, ooh, ooh
What you've done, what you've done
What you've done, ooh, ooh, ooh

Fighting the tears back
Fighting to make you stay
Screaming at angels
Holding a wall in my brain, yeah
Secrets are locked up
Prison cell in your heart, yeah
Kisses fall on her lips
The memory's left behind

I don't wanna know

What you've done, ooh, ooh, oohHard to read, you could be OCD
You could be bad for me, you could say anything
Sometimes I get a bit TMI, little bit scared of heights
Little afraid to say
You know the things that make me smile
The face I make before my tears fall down
The things that I feel when you're acting suspicious
You know the place I run to hide
I take my problems there to work ’em out

The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

Look at us, isn't it obvious?
Is it so dangerous? Is it so complicated?
You know the shapes my body makes
Under the sheets at 4 AM with you
The things that we break when we’re switchin' positions
You know the words to my mistakes
You understand because you made 'em too

The things that I say when you don't wanna listen
Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official

All of the things that we sometimes forget
All of the dreams that you put in my head
I'm still asleep, but there's breakfast in bed
These are the things that could make us official
Maybe the sky might not always be blue
All of my wishes will never come true
It doesn't matter 'cause I’m here with you
This stuff could make us official
So tell all your friends ’cause we're goin’ official

Things that you say when I make bad decisions
Things that we do by the sink in my kitchen
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us official
These are the things that could make us official
These are the things that could make us official
I remember our first date
No chocolate and no bouquet
But the way that you kissed me
These are the things that could make us officialI shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh

Make you pop a Tylenol, split your head and call it off
Got you drinking water when you should be drinking alcohol
Faster than an Adderall, make you shake your Audemars
Shake it, shake it, shake it, make you spray it like an aerosol

I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it

I shake it like Jamaican
No birthday, but I'm cakin'
I shake it like I'm tryna get the oil off of the bacon
If I need wakin', I'ma alarm that shakin'
This ass 'bout to move like I need the house vacant
It move, move, move, and you know it won't stop
It shakin' like I'm pulled over by a white cop
It shakin' like a virgin, 'bout to give up the box
Told 'em this ass a miracle, like my name Watts
I be purgin' shit, never nervous, bitch
I get on top of that dick, shake it like turbulence
You haven't heard from 'em since, I'm a different expense
And now this pussy need Staples like I'm fuckin' on Vince
Told 'em paddle, paddle, paddle 'cause this pussy in Seattle
I'ma fight my own battles, shake it harder than a rattle
He get in it, then he tackle, wanna bite it like a apple
And this pussy so juicy, when I cum it's made of Snapple, ayy

Brooke muthafuckin' Candy, Charli XCX
Miss CupcakKe is on this muthafuckin' track, oh

Tell me what you want, tell me what you want, daddy
Little bit of sugar, little bit of Brooke Candy
Cocaine-colored sheets where my ass bouncin' (Bounce)
'Bout to turn your mansion to the pussy palace
And shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale
My pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail
My pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup
I'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club
Hey, my ass is Magic City
Double Ds, all-natural big titties
Shake it like a box-fresh vibrator
Ass first-class, fast like Concorde
Damn, my ass so insane
Put me in a straightjacket, still you ain't safe
You can't handle all the jelly, put it on a plate
I'm 'bout to shake and leave you shook, like Beyoncé

(Shake it, I shake it, I sh- I shake it)
(I shake it, I sha- I shake it)
Oh darling, you say you don't know me?
(I sh- I shake it- I shake it)
Please, haha
(I sh- I shake it)
(Pabllo Vittar)

Pra começar direito eu soletro pra você
Rainha se escreve com dois L e dois T
Como estagiário no trabalho, eu tô sem tempo
Se tenho um problema eu resolvo com talento
Dedinho na boca, sou uma tentação
A pista pega fogo derretendo o paredão
Já mostrei que eu sou queen, falo sério pra vocês
A coroa é pesada, mas eu me acostumei
I shake it, I shake it, o meu popozão
I shake it, I shake it, aguentar essa pressão
Do MA, cheguei em LA
É a Pabllo e a Charli mais uma vez

I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you (XCX)
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh (Mais uma vez, haha)
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh (I love you, Charli, baby)
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shakeUh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Know I keep on saying I'm alright
But every single night
When I cut off the lights
I feel like crying
Your picture revolving in my mind
But then it turns to white
I guess I’ll go in blind
I feel like crying
Hope you can forgive all of my crimes
You read, but won't reply
I just need your reply
I feel like crying
Baby, all I need's a single night
A sign, a sign, give me a sign

Sorry I broke you down
Sorry I tore your heart
I ripped it all apart
Your headlights in the dark
Sorry ’bout Grammy night
Was flyin' out my mind
Was in a different place
Tortured and drifting by
Kept dancing in that house
The windows turned to black
My windows turned to black
My eyes were rolling back, yeah
Hope I get one more chance
Hope I get one more call
I only know what's good once I have lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all

Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I’ve done)
Hope you can forgive the things I’ve done
(Things I've done, things I’ve done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Reply, reply, give me a sign
Yeah

소-소-소심했던 나의
그 한 마디
미안하다고
사과하고 싶어도
너무 늦은 걸까?I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me, you don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future, ah

Ooh, I'm zooming like a jet ski, zoom zoom
Little dose of napalm, blow it up, yeah
Don't care what she talk about, nah
All she wanna do is my style, yeah
No one on my level
I play nice 'cause I'm too clever
I won't show it, never, never, but it's crystal (Woo)
I'm way up, way better
She might pop, but it's whatever
She might sell, but what's she selling?
Does she last long?
I know they write about me (Yeah)
I know that they all see me (Yeah)
Too scared so they don't play me
Some people tried to save me

Ooh, but I'm feeling so good
Better than I ever could
Had bad people in my business, gone now
Cage, prison, now it's gone away
They wanna listen what I say
Think I care about the fame?
Na-na-na-na

I pull up, roll up, fuck up
