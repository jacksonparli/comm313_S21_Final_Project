You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game
Like modern architecture, John Lautner coming your way
I know you like this beat 'cause Jeff's been doin' the damn thing
You wanna turn it up loud, Future Nostalgia is the name (Future nostalgia)

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future, future nostalgia)

No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya (Hey, hey)
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female alpha (No way, no way)
(Future nostalgia)
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya (Hey, hey)
(Future nostalgia)
I know you ain't used to a female alpha (No way, no way)
(Future nostalgia)

Can't be a rolling stone if you live in a glass house (Future nostalgia)
You keep on talking that talk, one day, you're gonna blast out
You can't be bitter if I'm out here showing my face (Future nostalgia)
You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future, future nostalgia)

No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya (Hey, hey)

You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
You can't get with this if you ain't built for this
I can't build you up if you ain't tough enough
I can't teach a man how to wear his pants (Haha)

I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future)
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound (Future, future nostalgia)

(Future nostalgia)
(Future nostalgia)
My sound, my sound, my sound
(Future, future nostalgia)If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up (Don't show up), don't come out (Don't come out)
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now)
Walk away (Walk away), you know how (You know how)
Don't start caring about me now (So)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away (So)
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, ohGuess I never had a love like this (Ah-ha)

You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

Living it up

And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

You want me, I want you, baby

I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah (Gonna break, gonna break)

I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

Exactly where I want me, yeah

Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)
Body make you silly, make you do what I want
Oh baby, I can make it pretty, I could string you along
But I'ma love you like a fool
Breathe you in till I hallucinate (Mmm)

No, I couldn't live without your touch
No, I could never have too much
I'll breathe you in forever and ever
Hallucinate

I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind

Wanna be right where you are
Let's go dancing in the dark
Don't wait, you can push to start, lose control
Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips
Damn, I need another hit
(Make me lose my mind)

I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in myI never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
(We're in love, we're in love)
(We're in love, we're in love, oh, oh)

I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (Again and again)
Again (And again and again and again)I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?(Hey!)

Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Oh-oh)
We drive each other mad (Oh-oh)
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what)

(Ah)
Yeah, we don't know how to talk (Mmm)
But damn, we know how to fuck

I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad (Ah)
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head (Messing with my head)
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Oh, please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us good in bed)

It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Mmm)
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bedIt's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet (Ah)

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright

Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
