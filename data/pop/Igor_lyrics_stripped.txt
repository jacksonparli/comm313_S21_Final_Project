She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand

My brother said I'm on the spectrum

She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right

Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em

I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me

What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? (Yours, yours, yours)

I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me
(Did I wait too long?)
I'm your puppet
(Did I wait too long?)
You control me

But at some point, you come to your sensesTurn my lights on
How the fuck you quiet with the mic on?
I don't get anxiety, you Sam Bowie-ass niggas
I just get my Mike on
Y'all said I wouldn't go nowhere, I took the detour
When you see the someone in the crack right by the seashore?
When you see them brand new le Fleurs on the floor?
If the cops ask my name, bitch, I'm Igor

Yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

Uh-huh, ayo
Uh-huh
Yeah, yo
Bitch

Running 'til the rims fall
Had them niggas and the cops looking jigsaw
I done fucked around and turned into the big dog
Better get God, get caught? Bitch, I think not
Yeah, new suit, new boots, same nigga, like what?
Lukewarm-ass niggas always wanna talk
I'm hot, I'm heat to the core like Earth
Don't touch, don't go, niggas might get buck

Yo, yuh, ayo
Yeah, yeah
Let's go, let's go, I ain't playin' around
Red nose, red nose, all you niggas is clowns
Niggas turning it up, well, shit, I'm tearing it down
Hard to believe in God when there ain't no mirrors around
What's up?

Whoop, uh huh
Yeah, bitch

Um, I see the light
To pay attention and to keep your motherfucking eyes glued to the man that's in front of you?
I see the light
That's what the fuck I expect all y'all motherfuckers to do
I see the light

Dracula, Dracula, Dracula
Suck me first, I might get back at ya (I see the light)
Is that shit clear? Check the aperture
Hahahahaha, I can't laugh at ya (I see the light)
This the shit that make you nervous
'Bout to go buck wild, nigga, Steve Irwin (I see the light)
Sick of that 'Claren talk, I'm on my third one
Niggas talkin' reckless, I never heard 'em (I see the light)

I see the light

(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light
(Buck, don't touch, though, my niggas might get buck, don't touch, though)
I see the light

That car crash couldn't take me (Woo, ha)
Green haired angels all around me (Uh)
No answer why, no tears to cry, bitch, I'm alive (I see the)
That wasn't my endpoint like v-neck
I ain't have nobody to cheat on, I cheat death
New album, no repeat, I reset
Everything I deliver special like G. Dep
Two of 'em, I total, Kima, Pam
Me and death, the universe played middle man
Quick nap, kick back like horse, eyes shut
Loud sound, no scratch
Motherfuckers really thought I died
Hoping they could take a spot
Nigga not knowing that I'm one of one
And they some Helen Keller-ass niggas
And I got my eyes open now I see the...

Light
I see the light
You never wanna meet a motherfucker like me
I see the light (I said)
I see the light
I see the light
I don't know what's harder, letting go or just being okay with itComparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone

You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You keep me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going away, and now I'm scarred for life

My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

(My love is gone)
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
(My love is gone)
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)

I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul


Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

(Got my eye)
I said go, go

Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

Again, again
Again, again
(Got my eye)See, um, heavy feelings for you, yeah, yeah, it's no secret
You too cool for me and I ain't tryna freeze up
Like the Johnsons, nonsense, I would speak up
And realize there's more fish in the sea, I'ma re-up
Like, bitch, I know my shit is bumping, it's eczema
So I won't walk around with my head down like I got beat up
Um, you do you, I'll do me, I’ll just chuck the peace up
I ain't tryna keep up, because

I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
But this just might be better for us, you know?

('Cause I don't love like I used to)
Where did time go, I need location
('Cause you don't wanna talk about it, baby)
That's all that I know, I, I, I, I
Where did time go?

But now, movin' on, but how?
Uh, somethin' put my feelings in the lost and found
Now I'm stuck forever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever
Forever, and ever, and ever
I don't love you no more
Tell me where to go
Can I have my heart back? (Heart back)

I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore (You wasted my time and I know that these things are not hard)
'Cause I don't love you anymore
But this just might be better for us, you kn-Dream

Don't say, "Goodbye, smell you later" (Later)
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah
Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend

(Friends)
Are we still friends? (This can't end)
Are we still friends? (I still wanna say hi)
Are we, are we, are we, are we still friends?
