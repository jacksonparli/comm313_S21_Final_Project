Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said "I love you"
You're fun and you’re wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah

'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue

Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?

'Cause you’re just a man
It’s just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue
You make me blue

Blue, blue
Blue, blue, blue
Blue, blue, blueYou took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am

And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?Fear fun, fear love
Fresh out of fucks forever
Tryin' to be stronger for you
Ice cream, ice queen
I dream in jeans and leather
Live stream, I'm sweet for you

Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made

Give me Hallmark
One dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy in blue
Norman Rockwell
No hype under our covers
It's just me and you

Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss

You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away

You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane

Oh God, want you on my lips (I do, I do)
It's me, your little Venice bitch (Yes, it is)
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss

Oh, shatter (Yeah), oh, shatter (Yeah, yeah), oh, shatter (Yeah)
(Soundin' off, bang bang, kiss kiss)
Yeah (Yeah), oh (Yeah), oh (Yeah)

Yeah, yeah

You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over

Oh God, I love him on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
Touch me with your fingertips
It's me, your little Venice bitch

Back, back in the garden
We're getting high now because we're older
Me myself, I like diamonds
My baby, crimson and clover

If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your loveI like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
"Maybe  I'll do it differently"

So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly

Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do

It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, braids in my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
(I really do)
It's killing me slowly

Fuck it, I love you (I moved to California, but it's just a state of mind)
Fuck it, I love you (It turns out everywhere you go, you take yourself, that's not a lie)
Fuck it, I love you (Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine)
I really do (It's killing me slowly)

(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(Fuck it, I love you)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
(I really do)
Jazz in my veins, running out of time
(Fuck it, I love you)
California dreamin', got my money on my mind

Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder

Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me

Evil, we've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely

We go fast, we go so fast, we don’t move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin’ through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you

Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I’m here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I’d just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song

Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere ’cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?

Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I’m a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around

The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love songCinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did

There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever didJohn met me down on the boulevard
Cry on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear

Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear

This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear


Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
As I whisper in your ear

I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhere(One, two, three, four)

You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, baby
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars

I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing
(Two, three, four)

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, and, honey
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars

You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
Changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
(Two, three, four)

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long

Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me upMy baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had ’til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight‚ I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was '70s in spirit‚ '90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had 'til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
’Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

Whatever’s on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I’m taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it

It's you‚ all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do, all the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar

Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it
There's something that I never knew I wantedI miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo

Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall

And I'm wasted
Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all


I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends‚ we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When‚ baby, I was doing nothin' the most of all

The culture is lit, and if this is it‚ I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all

If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothin' the most of all
Hawaii just missed that fireball
L.A. is in flames‚ it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars?" ain't just a song
I hope the live stream's almost onAll the ladies of the canyon
Wearing black to their house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi

But sometimes, girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bar-t-t-tender

All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing white for their tea parties
Playing games of levitation
Meditating in the garden

And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
And when at last the day is done, I grab my keys

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender
Ha, ha, ha, ha

I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Here to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bar-t-t-tender, hold me all night
Bar-t-t-tender, keep love alive
Bar-t-t-tenderDo you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer

Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you

Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah

Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy

If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt

I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you

Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With you (Dance)
Baby, I just wanna dance (Dance)
With youI was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"

I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past

There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I have
