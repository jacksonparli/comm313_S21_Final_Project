And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time

Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat

(Ah-ah)
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long (For too long)
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch (Out the touch)
I feel the rush and it's amazing, hmm

Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (Want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (Out of its way)
'Cause I know (Oh yeah), all I know (Oh yeah), all I know (Oh yeah)

Woooo, woooo, woooo (Ohh)
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold (Empty and so cold)
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo

I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreams(Ooh, ooh)
(Ooh, ooh)
Oh, yeah, I said

Angel, oh-oh-oh-oh, knew you were special from the moment
I saw you (Saw you), I saw you, yeah

Know this (Know this,) yeah, I know this, aw man
I said angel, woah-oh-oh-oh, I'm so desensitized to feeling
These emotions (Emotions,) yeah, no emotions, baby

'Cause all I see are wings
All I can see, your wings, but I know what I am and the life I live
(Life I live) Yeah, the life I live, and even though I sin
We all wanna live, but I know time will tell if we're meant for this
